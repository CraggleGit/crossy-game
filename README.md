# crossy-game
 Simple Crossy Road type game using pygame library. 
 
 How to play: 

 1. Run main.py to launch the game
 2. Use the UP and DOWN keys to move the player
 3. You level up by reaching the treasure, and the game will increase in difficulty (speed and number of skeletons)
 4. If you collide with a skeleton, the game is reset to the default speed and difficulty

TODO: Package the game so that it can be run from a single executable. Add more enemy types and maps.
